# Insurance Price Prediction

## Overview
The **Insurance Price Prediction** project aims to predict insurance charges based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, and smoking status. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques, specifically **Linear Regression**, to model and predict insurance prices accurately.

This repository contains the code, dataset, and necessary documentation to train and evaluate a predictive model for insurance pricing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the individual.
- **sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female).
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **children**: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- **smoker**: Smoking status (yes/no).
- **region**: The residential region of the individual (e.g., northeast, southwest).
- **charges**: The insurance cost (target variable).

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed before running the project:

- **Python 3.7** or higher
- **Pip** (Python package installer)
- **Virtual environment** (recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manvikkhandal/project.git
