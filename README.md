## Projects Overview

### Calories Burnt Prediction
A regression model that predicts the number of calories burnt during physical activity using factors like age, gender, heart rate, and duration of exercise.

### House Price Prediction
This project utilizes machine learning models to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, and condition of the house. It employs Linear Regression for predictive analysis.

### Loan Approval Prediction
A classification model built to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected, based on input features like income, credit score, and loan amount.

### Insurance Price Prediction
Predicts the cost of insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, and smoking status. The model is built using machine learning regression techniques.

### Bike Price Prediction
A machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a bike based on features like brand, model, engine capacity, and mileage.

### Movie Recommendation System
A content-based recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their previous viewing habits and movie ratings.

### Chatbot
A chatbot built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can engage in basic conversation and assist users with queries.

### Email Classification
A text classification project that categorizes emails as spam or not spam using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

### Cat and Dog Classification
A deep learning image classification model that differentiates between images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

### Farmer Crop Suggestion
A machine learning project aimed at suggesting the best crops for farmers to grow based on environmental and soil conditions.
